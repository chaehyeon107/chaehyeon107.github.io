We are planning a restaurant app web project at Jeonbuk National University. We are currently recruiting team members, and if my leave of absence is confirmed, I plan to gather team members and work on the project.

<!--more-->

The project is planned to be distributed and operated unconditionally.
- Due to the nature of the concept, it is highly accessible and targeted at Chonbuk National University students, so it is expected to be in high demand. 
    -> Experience user usage analysis and maintenance

- The purpose is to use it as a meaningful experience in an employment portfolio. 
- The purpose is not to complete the work in a short time, but to learn.
- Aims to follow field development processes such as test-driven development (TDD)

Project-Oriented Elements 
- share
- Communication
- record

The goal is to implement both apps and web.
Reason: The web allows you to gain experience in web development (especially Spring), and the app has its own advantages, such as good usability. 
I think this could be a good opportunity to use and apply REST API.
