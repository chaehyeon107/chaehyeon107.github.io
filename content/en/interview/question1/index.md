The work of designing underlying structures, managing servers, and optimizing processes has always appealed to me. The backend may not be visible, but it plays a crucial role. Enhancing program performance, managing traffic, continuous debugging, and maintenance all require a broad domain of knowledge, which I find to be a significant challenge.

Even though the results may not be immediate, I enjoy the process of solving complex systems and bringing my ideas to life as I work towards implementing the final outcome.
