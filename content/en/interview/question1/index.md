I think the work of designing structures performed at the bottom, managing servers, and improving process efficiency appealed to me. The backend is invisible but plays an important role. The fact that broad domain knowledge is required to perform many roles, such as improving program performance, traffic management, and continuous debugging and maintenance, also seems to me to be a great challenge. 
Even if the results are not immediate, I find the process of completing the idea in my head by unraveling a complex system to realize the results to be fun.
