What I value most in my work is **challenge and initiative**. Challenges help me grow and open up new opportunities. Since the field I work in is constantly evolving, it’s essential to have a mindset that embraces these changes. To do this, I set **step-by-step** goals, steadily working through small steps to achieve larger objectives.

In the process of starting with small goals and gradually moving towards bigger ones, I learn a lot. I also believe it’s important **not to fear recognizing my own shortcomings**. Acknowledging where I lack and striving to fill those gaps through self-learning and gaining diverse experiences is what drives my growth. This process of challenge and continuous growth is the core value in my approach to work.
