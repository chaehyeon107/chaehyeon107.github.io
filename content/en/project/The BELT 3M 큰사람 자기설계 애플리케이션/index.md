title: The BELT 3M Keunsaram Self-design Application
date: 2024-03-28

This is a big person project management application development project. 

Reason for planning: There are many activities to do to win a belt, and there are many things to check in the process of planning and executing them, so students are having difficulty. To solve these problems and help students obtain the Big Man belt more easily, we planned to develop an application that could manage announcements on the school website, Big Man project manuals, and to-do plans in one place.

Configuration: To-do list page, announcement page, manual page, current belt point calculation page 

Positive Effects: Maintaining interest in big peopleâ€™s projects, being able to check notices and manuals at once in one space, and managing activities systematically.
