This project involved developing an Android app that cloned Instagram, called "Storygram." The app is designed as a diary in the style of Instagram.

**Purpose**: Perhaps what everyone needs is their own story—a space to leave behind my story, a story I may not want to share but still want to record. By recording my daily life, I create my personal narrative.

**Concept**: A personal diary for recording daily life (emphasizing the diary aspect rather than Instagram).

**Reason for using the Instagram format**: By adopting Instagram's post format for the diary, the app gains a sleek image, while offering the familiarity and accessibility of Instagram for posting content.

**Reason for choosing the project name**: The name "Storygram" is derived from Instagram's "gram." The other candidate was "Diarygram." Although we could have used the keyword "diary" in the name, given the concept of recording daily life, we ultimately decided to use "story" to reflect our goal: creating a space where users can record and build their own stories. Hence, the name "Storygram."

**Reminder feature advantage**: One of the joys of a diary is reminiscing when you look back at old entries. The reminder feature will help users recall the stories they've written, providing a distinguishing feature from Instagram.

**Project features**:
- Reminder
- To-do list management
- Daily life recording
