This is a project that involved learning Java GUI while creating a shooting game using popular characters. 
The project name is ‘Who is the Last Green Dinosaur?’ and it is a shooting game with three green dinosaur characters: Yoshi, Dooly, and Crong. 
It is made up of pure JAVA and is meaningful in that it can be used to create a game that can understand the flow of processes and threads by combining many objects and elements.
The reason for planning this project is to improve understanding of Java operations by programming based on Java grammar. In addition, we planned this game because it is a game with a level of difficulty suitable for learning Java.

The game method is that three green dinosaurs avoid meteorites within the game, and the last remaining dinosaur wins.
There are six game elements: Yoshi, Dooly, Crong, HP, meteorite (HP is deducted when hit), and star (HP is increased when hit).
Each character object stores movement functions, basic positions, images, etc. The relationship between all objects operates as a thread and is structured in such a way that the game progresses/
